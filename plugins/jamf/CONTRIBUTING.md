# Contributing
* Before starting work on a new feature, please open an Issue so we can discuss it and make sure it aligns with the goals and values of the project.
* You do not need to open an Issue when fixing a bug.

# Code Formatting
* Please try to format your code like the existing code to make it easier for other contributors to read.
* Try to keep lines down to less than 100 characters, and definately not larger than 150 unless there are special requirements that prevent shortening it.
* Keep code comments in English please.

# Pull Request Process
* If this is the first feature or bug after the last release, please increment the version (and GLPI versions) in setup.php accordingly.
* Add a short description of the feature or fix in the Changelog file under the appropriate version header.
* If modifying SCSS or JS files, make sure to update the CSS and minfied JS files as well as these are what users will be using. The SCSS and JS files are just to make development easier. It helps if your IDE supports automatically compiling SCSS and minifying JS.
* All pull requests must pass automated checks and a manual review by the project maintainer.

# Translation
All translations are done in [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/BepTgrM7ab) and not directly in the MO/PO files. If you want to contribute to an existing language in the project, you can request access and I will approve it as soon as I can. I am not allowing joining without approval only to prevent potential spam.

If you want to add a new language to the project, please open an Issue to request it. I will set up the language in POEditor and add you as a contributor. You will be automatically invited if you have an email address listed on your profile, or you can manually request access after it is set up.
