directly from the Ticket form.

To do it, you must follow these steps:

* Creation of different types of credit vouchers (as GLPI dropdown);
* Creation, in **Entity** tab, of the credit vouchers available for these entities;
* Declaration / Modification / Deletion of a consumption in the **Ticket** form and tab;
* Consultation of the vouchers sold, the remaining credits, credits consumptions from the **Ticket** form or from **Entity** tab.
